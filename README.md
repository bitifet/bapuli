Abstract
--------

Take a list of backup files from stdin and generate a list of those which
can be removed according to given rules.

Each argument represents a rule of two time intervals separated by a colon. We
will call them *age* and *frequency*, respectively:

  * **Age:** Represents the minimum age of a file (how much time ago) for the
    rule starting to apply.

  * **Frequency:** Is the maximum allowed interval between two consecutive
    *preserved* (that is: omitted in the output) backups.

Below rules apply too:

  * Oldest file is always kept.

  * All rules apply from the *ending date* of the next rule to its own. Except
    last one which apply from the oldest file's date.

  * After the first rule's age, all files are kept.

  * Both intervals sould consist of a number and an unit name (ex: "1year")
    with no spaces.
    - If number is omitted, then `1` is assumed.
    - If unit is ommitted, then `day` is assumed.
    - Valid units are below (and in fact any of [MomentJS
      Duration](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/creating/) units will
      work):


| Key            | Shorthand |
|----------------|-----------|
| year(s)        | y         |
| month(s)       | M         |
| week(s)        | w         |
| day(s)         | d         |
| hour(s)        | h         |
| minute(s)      | m         |
| second(s)      | s         |
| millisecond(s) | ms        |


File list is read from stdin (one file per row) and it is returned the same way
through stdout with kept files being removed so it can be used as input for a
deletion process.

  * All file name is supposed to contain a 'YYYYMMDD'-formatted date in its name
(first matching pattern will be assumed).

  * Files not following this pattern are ignored (even warning message is send
    to stderr).

  * File names can contine absolute or relative paths. In this case they will
    be grouped by its actual path string (so multiple backup lists can be
    processed at once if required rules are the same).


Compilation
-----------

```sh
npm run build
```

> You will find binary compiled for your OS under `build` directory.


Installation
------------

After compiled, take `bapuli` binary and place a copy of it under a route under
your execution path (like `/usr/local/bin`).


Usage example
-------------

```sh
    find path/to/my_backups -type f \
      | bapuli 1:1 1week:week 3month:1month 1year:1year 5year:10year \
      | perl -pe 'print "rm "' \
      | bash
```

This will generate a list of all files under specified directory that can be
removed ensuring to keep:

  * All files from up to 1 day before.

  * One file every day from those older than one day ( `1:1` ) up to first week
    ago (according to next rule).

  * One file per week from first week ( `1week:week` ) and up to 3 months old.

  * One file per month from 3 months ago ( `3month:1month` )...

  * One file per year from 1 year ago ( `1year:1year` )...

  * One file every ten years from 5 years ago ( `5year:10year` ).

  * Oldest file.
    - Oldest file is always preserved. In fact all calculations are made from
      that to current time.
